#8733 - Kissimmee
#Unfortunately, the name Kissimmee is both fairly recent and also of unknown origin. Another name could have been Osceola, but that name comes from the Seminole chief Osceola, so no dice.
#This province contains most of modern Osceola county, as well as parts of Polk and Highlands Counties. Its western edge is roughly the Green Swamp.
